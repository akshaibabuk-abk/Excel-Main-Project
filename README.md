Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard

This project is an interactive Sales Dashboard created using Microsoft Excel to analyze the performance of a coffee shop over multiple years. The dataset was already cleaned, so the focus was on data visualization and dashboard creation.

After importing the dataset, pivot tables were created to summarize key metrics such as total transactions, total quantity sold, total revenue, and total profit. Various charts were then used to visualize insights — bar charts for category-wise transactions and revenue, a line chart for weekday transaction count, a donut chart for yearly revenue comparison, pie chart for city-wise revenue percentage, and column charts for monthly profit and revenue. Slicers for year, month, and city were added to make the dashboard interactive.

The dashboard provides a clear overview of sales trends, profit performance, and category-wise contributions, helping to evaluate overall business growth and city-level performance.
